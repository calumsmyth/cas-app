            <p>
                Welcome to my 'About me' page. I think most people find it a little bizzare to talk about themselves, but writing and entire webpage about me feels particularly unusual! 
                <br />Let's see how this goes....
                <br />
                <br />
                After finishing my A-levels and leaving school, I attended Coventry University for my undergraduate degree, where I achieved a 2:1 in Biomedical science BSc (Hons).
                <br />
                Within a few months of completing my undergraduate degree, I began studying a Postgraduate Diploma in Physician Associate Studies and the University of Manchester. This was a 2 year course which was a pass/fail qualification and I passed at the start of 2018.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once I graduated from a student Physician Associate to a qualified Physician Associate (PA), I spent years working across different hospital specialties (and through the COVID pandemic), before moving into General Practice, during this time I was given the oppotunity to work as a Lead Physician Associate; a role in which I led a team of PA colleagues across multiple GP sites.
                <br />
                <br />
                Over the last 1-2 years I found myself developing a growing interest in the area of software and web development. For as long as I can remember I have been an avid user of computers and games consoles. Technology has always featured in my life, but, around this time I found myself wanting to learn more. I started by subscribing to 'The Odin Project', an online web development course, where I put in over 100 hours of self-driven study, while working a full time job in the NHS.
                <br />
                Towards the end of 2024 a change of personal circumstance lead me to leaving my job as a PA. I took this opportunity to sign up to a bootcamp titled 'AI-Driven Software Engineering' provided by 'Skills City' which runs until March 2025. Topics covered on this 12-week, full time course include: [ Web Development, Github, Javascript, React, Python, SQL, Flask, Django, APIs, AI/ML supervised and unsupervised learning, Cloud computing ] and more. This bootcamp has grown my passion even further and has been a driver in my ambition to make a full career change into a development role.
                <br />
                <br />
                While still new to the world of development, my experience of working in the NHS demonstrates that I am a hard worker who holds himself to the highest standards, even in pressured environments. I take pride in my work, I am adaptable and I have a strong drive to learn. I strive to deliver to the best of my abilities, while always trying to push my capabilities further. I am an effective communicator who works well in a team, but can also work well independantly. I have experience leading a team of highly qualified individuals and I always look to support and develop those around me too. These are just a selection of transferable skills which I believe are beneficial to develop within any enviornment, and I hope to use these to my advantage on my journey into this new and exciting career.
